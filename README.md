# Research Papers Portfolio

## Overview

This repository contains academic research papers developed during my undergraduate studies in physics and through independent research conducted in my own time. The works collected here reflect a combination of theoretical analysis, computational modeling, and applied algorithm development.

## Contents

The repository includes the following manuscripts:

* **Bachelor’s Thesis**: *Honeycomb Kitaev Model – Anyons in an Exactly Solved Model and Beyond*:
  A comprehensive theoretical study of the Kitaev honeycomb model, flux sectors, Majorana fermions, complex bond and matter fermions, and topological phase transitions, developed as part of my undergraduate degree in physics.

* **Research Paper**: *Dynamic Evolution of Fermionic Parity in the Kitaev Honeycomb Model*:
  A theoretical–computational investigation of how local gauge variations affect global fermionic parity, based on large-scale lattice simulations and Pfaffian calculations.

* **Technical Paper**: *Dynamic Exposure and Gain Control in a Dynamic Environment*:
  A noise-aware algorithm for real-time exposure and gain control in imaging systems, combining image-gradient analysis, entropy measures, and temporal smoothing.

## Purpose

This repository serves as a consolidated research portfolio for graduate-level (MSc) applications and academic evaluation. All documents are provided as completed manuscripts or technical reports and represent original work completed during my undergraduate studies and independent research time.
